Task (10 marks)
1. Take two string inputs, calculate lengths of both (without using strlen()) and display the smaller
one.
 2. Write a program to compare two strings without using C library function.

3. Declare two strings A and B of size 100 and 50, respectively. Then take user input of both strings.
Concatenate (join) B at the end of A using loop. Display the concatenated string.
Enter first string: Bangla
Enter second string: desh
After joining, first string: Bangladesh

4. Check whether an input string is palindrome or not. A string is a palindrome if it remains the
same after you reverse it. For example, “racecar”, “level”, “12321”, “madam” etc.
Enter a string: racecar
